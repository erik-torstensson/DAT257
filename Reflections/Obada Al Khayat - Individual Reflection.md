Obada Al Khayat - Individual Reflection

# Week 1


I want to learn more about agile project management system in general and how to cooperate with other team members from other programs 
than IT who have experience in different fields and learn from their point of view.

Since I have used Scrum before in a previous course, I can help with explaining the general aspect of Scrum to other team members 
who have not used Scrum befroe.  However, I still need to read more about it and learn how to get the most of it in a larger project. 
 
We haven't started the project yet, so there is no much to do in Scrum board other than creating the main structure
and deciding which platform to use. And since I worked with Scrum before, as I mentioned above, 
I created the Scrum board for the team on Trello.

This week we had a meeting on Discord and discussed the social contract and wrote the first version together.

# Week 2 

This week we contacted our external stakeholder Kim Lantto; he gave us the idea and some information about the problem we need to solve.  He then connected us with the IT department in parkeringgoteborg to discuss possible solutions based on the available data and resources. Yet we have no much to implement this week and during Easter week since our meeting with the IT department will be after Easter.

# Week 3 

This week was our first week with actual programming; the first sprint, we hade tasks fewer than 7, so we had to do pair programming to complete the tasks. Julia and I worked on the map function, and the rest did the calendar function. After adding the map to the application, I added markers to the map over all the locations. 

It felt a bit unclear who is responsible for what, and what is the waited result of the task I'm doing. And I think our meetings weren't so productive, we didn't know what to discuss in every meeting, and some meetings took a very long time with no progress just because we hade no structure. 

So we thought of having a scrum master who will be responsible for running the meetings and have a broader look at the whole team and who is doing what. Every Monday ( at the beginning of newsprint ), we will randomly choose a new scrum master, so all the team members get a chance to try this role. 

I think this way, our meetings will be more productive, and in turn, this will give us more time to work on the project.

# Week 4 

In our meeting with Kim, he mentioned how could the info window be represented. The most important thing about the info window is to make the language as simple as possible,
use "Lätt Svenska" so any user could benefit from this web-application. He suggested making the markers change its color depending on the availability of the parking.

# Week 5 

This week Anas and I continued working on the map and improving the pop-up info window, we added relevant info that we
think it is the most important for the user. 
We had an issue with the database, where there is a location with no number of spaces, which caused the application to crash when getting the number of spaces for all parking. We fixed it by adding a condition to show "Ej tillänglig" when this data is missing. We presented this issue with the database in our meeting with Kim.  

In our meeting with Kim, Jonas och Lisa, they suggested adding a highlight/border around the area when the user searches for parking with multiple positions. This would give the user a better experience and make it easier to know precisely where specific parking is located. We are thinking of adding this feature in the following sprint next week.
