**Summary of week 7**

Week 7, the last week before the presentation, mostly consisted of making the final touches on our product. The last important functions were implemented and we focused a lot on the user experience. We fine-tuned the frontend to make the application easier to understand and use. We were also able to locate and find remedies for a few bugs in the code.

Work on the final reflection has begun and we have also started to analyze the results of the user survey. The results did not affect the functionality of the application, but was used to get an idea of the value of such an application for the citizens of Gothenburg.

**Customer Value and Scope**

This week, we prioritized finalizing the calendar and map functions. These are some of the more crucial functions of the application and must work without incident. Furthermore we focused on making the application easier to browse and understand by working on the overall design. This included the use of icons for adding cleaning times to your preferred calendar. This prioritization and focus was done in order to give as much value as we could to our stakeholder in the time we had left. 

To make sure we can bring the users the best product possible we have continued to work diligently with our KPIs. As usual, we have kept track of the sprint velocity, stress levels and also made sure our code reviews were conducted in a structured and well-documented way.

**Social Contract and Effort**

No changes to the social contract, no enforcements.

Design decisions and product structure
This week we prioritized to make the product work. We didn’t have time for more functionality, but all our user stories have been covered. After the user study we discovered some other functionality that could improve the product further, but the most important stuff seemed to be solved already.
We improved the GUI, for example in the “Info Window”, the pop-up window when a user clicks a parking marker on the map. We replaced some text with icons, and colors. Added CSS classes for different types of info window. The pop-up have some differences depending on time left until parking restriction, if it’s a night parking etc.
Further, we solved bugs to make the dates and times accurate. 
We also finished the work with Outlook calendar. 
 
Use of icons, instead of text. Highlighting of boxes etc.
how your design decisions (e.g., choice of APIs, architecture patterns, behaviour) support customer value
which technical documentation you use and why (e.g. use cases, interaction diagrams, class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams, text documents)
how you use and update your documentation throughout the sprints
how you ensure code quality and enforce coding standards

**Application of Scrum**

The roles we have used remained the same as the previous weeks. A scrum master which is the only role we felt we needed. The tasks of a scrum master remained the same such as: the sprint’s workflow, reflections etc. 

We felt the need of having more meetings since it was the last week of the project. Our meetings were extended to ensure that we do not have any conflicts in the code or merge conflicts. We discussed different topics such as: The code, the design, bugs, the presentation and the final report. 

For the presentation we decided that Erik and Anas will take care of where Erik introduces the idea of the app and Anas demonstrates it. For the final reflections we decide to have meetings at the same time as before.
