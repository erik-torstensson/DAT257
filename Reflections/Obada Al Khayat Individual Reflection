Obada Al Khayat - Individual Reflection

------ Week 1 ------

What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn more about agile project management system in general and how to cooperate with other team members from other programs 
than IT who have experience in different fields and learn from their point of view.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Since I have used Scrum before in a previous course, I can help with explaining the general aspect of Scrum to other team members 
who have not used Scrum befroe.  However, I still need to read more about it and learn how to get the most of it in a larger project. 


What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
 
We haven't started the project yet, so there is no much to do in Scrum board other than creating the main structure
and deciding which platform to use. And since I worked with Scrum before, as I mentioned above, 
I created the Scrum board for the team on Trello.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

This week we had a meeting on Discord and discussed the social contract and wrote the first version together.
