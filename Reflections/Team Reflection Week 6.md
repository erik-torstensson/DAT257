**Summary of week 6**

During week 6 we improved our work flow according to our quality KPI. Code reviewers were assigned during the start of the sprint and we made sure to make good use of our code quality checklist. The amount of rejected pull requests has increased, but this only ensures higher quality code.

We have had continued progress with our application, with a few new features and fixes added. We have also structured and conducted a user survey, which was shared via Facebook as well as placing flyers on residentially parked cars.

**Customer Value and Scope**

We added functionality for a new user story which covered the need of showing adjacent parkings, as suggestion to the user if a parking is not available. 

To confirm our earlier conclusion/user stories, but also to potentially discover new needs, we did a user survey which we posted on facebook and as QR-code on physical flyers on residential parkings.

**Social Contract and Effort**

We have updated our social contract and added Code review as a new KPI, we decided that two members at least should review the pull request before merging it into master. And that the merge should be done before starting with the new sprint on Mondays.

**Design decisions and product structure**

We have improved our code quality by using a checklist. We have updated the checklist to enforce higher coding standards. This resulted in cleaner code that is well documented, well implemented and easy to understand.

**Application of Scrum**

We have conducted a user survey that collects features that the end-user would find valuable in the finished product. Userbase was reached both through facebook and with signs on parked cars. The plan is to later on in this sprint analyse the collected data and hopefully write new and better user stories that we can solve in the upcoming sprints. 

The problems we had last week regarding the lack of reviews was “solved” by introducing a system where two reviewers are chosen by the “requester”. The two reviewers should not be involved in the task, and be random but with some oversight making sure that the same persons are not chosen all the time.
