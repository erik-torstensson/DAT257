Obada Al Khayat - Individual Reflection

# Week 1

What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to learn more about agile project management system in general and how to cooperate with other team members from other programs 
than IT who have experience in different fields and learn from their point of view.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Since I have used Scrum before in a previous course, I can help with explaining the general aspect of Scrum to other team members 
who have not used Scrum befroe.  However, I still need to read more about it and learn how to get the most of it in a larger project. 


What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
 
We haven't started the project yet, so there is no much to do in Scrum board other than creating the main structure
and deciding which platform to use. And since I worked with Scrum before, as I mentioned above, 
I created the Scrum board for the team on Trello.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

This week we had a meeting on Discord and discussed the social contract and wrote the first version together.

# Week 4 

In our meeting with Kim, he minstioned how could the info window be represnted. The most important think with the info window is to make the language as simple as possible,
use "Lätt svenska" so any user could benifet from this web-application. He suggested to make the markers change its colour depending on the availability of the parking.

# Week 5 

This week me and Anas continued working on map and improving the pop-up info window, we added relevant info that we
think is the most important for the user. 
We had an issue whith the database, where there is a location that has no number of spaces, and this caused the application to crach when getting the number
of spaces for all parkings. We fixed it by adding a condition to show "Ej tillänglig" when this data is missing. We presented this issue with the database in our meeting with Kim.  

In our meeting with Kim, Jonas och Lisa they suggested that adding a highlaigth/border araound the area when the user search up for a parking with multiple postions.
This would give the user a better experience and make it easier to know exactly where a specific parking is located. We are thinking to add this feature in the following sprint next week.
